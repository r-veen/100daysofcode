# Welcome to My @Replit 100 Days of Code Repository!

Hi there! I'm Rouven, and I'm 11 years old. I’m taking part in a super fun challenge called "@Replit 100 Days of Code." This is my special spot where I save everything I learn each day. Replit gives me a new coding challenge to solve every day with Python, and it's really cool!

In this repository, you'll find:
- My solutions for each daily challenge. I write comments in my code so you (and I!) can understand what I’ve done.
- Stories about the problems I ran into and how I solved them.
- Extra stuff I learn that helps me get better at programming.

I want to get better at coding, but I also want to write everything down so I can look back on what I’ve learned later. Maybe it will help other kids who are learning to code too. Feel free to look at my codes and give me tips if you want. Let's learn and get better together in this 100-day coding challenge!

For more information about the course, you can check out Replit’s official announcement [here](https://blog.replit.com/100-days-of-code).

Happy coding!
